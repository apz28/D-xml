# dlang-xml
XML DOM Implementation for DLang

Boost Software License - Version 1.0

This is my first package written in D. Just discovered D few months ago and this is a great way of learning it.

Some features in this implementation

f1. Supports different encodings (char, wchar & dchar)

f2. SAX parsing with parent node tracking

f3. Can be filtered nodes while loading

f4. Pretty output

f5. XPath (selectNodes, selectSingleNode)

f6. Support custom entity

f7. Compare to current phobo\std.xml -> less memory used and twice as fast with validation while parsing


Still lacking document but you can read it from below link if the function name matched
