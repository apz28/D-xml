# dlang-xml
XML DOM Implementation for DLang

Boost Software License - Version 1.0

This is my first package written in D. Just discovered D few months ago and this is a great way of learning it.
Some features in this implementation

1. Supports different encodings (char, wchar & dchar)

2. SAX parsing with parent node tracking

3. Can be filtered nodes while loading

3. Pretty output

4. XPath (selectNodes, selectSingleNode)

5. Support custom entity

6. Compare to current phobo\std.xml -> less memory used and twice as fast with validation while parsing



Samples on how to use are in unit tests

Still lacking document but you can read it from below link if the function name matched
